# stories
This repo is meant to house HTML, Javascript, and CSS code to make a static website to house my short stories.
I aim to first build a plain site and see how I can improve it over time. With the final goal making a presentable site where people can read my short stories. 
Its a combination of a coding and writing project. 

In regards to the stories themselves, they will be short stories that will vary wildly in theme and settings.
