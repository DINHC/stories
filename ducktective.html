                    In a world where humans live alongside intelligent, speaking animals, who all wear some degree of clothing, you would think the world will be a sillier and more peaceful place. But you are dead wrong. As the days get shorter and the nights longer, the shady folk seem to always make their way out of the shadows. I sleep on the fourth floor of an old apartment building in the downtown area of Newark City but every time I try to sleep I hear sirens at all times of the night. I already have a hard time sleeping due to my profession. Yet on occasion, some nights are silent and I can sleep. A night without sirens during this season was a blessing. Yet, usually, after the sirens ring out at night that meant gossip, rumors, and news the next morning. Each new day brought light to a new crime. Robbery. Arson. 
                    Yet recently, the crime that has people spooked and scampering around was the wacking of the Union Park maintenance worker two days ago by the name of Edward Moleton. From what I gathered from people already he was a simple mole. A family man, honest, and hardworking. He couldn’t see well but with the help of his coworkers managed to get by on his job. Apparently, he was crushed under the park statue and killed instantly. Now folks would rule it out as an accident but some observant lookie-loos spotted the crime scene and noted the statue that was bolted down, mind you, had been tampered with. Various descriptions reached my ears but the one conclusive thing I could tie together was that the statue's bolts were removed and at the bottom of the statue were several large scrapes indicating that a metallic tool or several tools, were used to tilt it and make it fall down on poor Edward. 
                    This caused rumors to spread around the city that it was either a hit by an unknown assailant from the UnderGrove, a casualty of a turf war between the local Emu Gang and Bison Gang, or a murderer on the loose. In any case, someone ends up dead and I, knowing my profession and luck, will be dragged into it sooner or later.

                    Just like that, I waddle to my office which is a couple blocks south of my apartment. I try my best to avoid getting hit by both cars and other pedestrians. Humans and animals alike. When I finally reached the office, I said the usual hello to my secretary, Dolores. Dolores is a red-headed, 21-year-old student at a local university, who after some shenanigans and some back and forth regarding her future, she was fine working for me. I pay her well but my reputation and stature lead much to be desired. So after a whole monologue, you must wonder who I am. Well, my name is Deckard Duckington and I am a two-foot-tall white duck with a slightly scruffy feather on the top of my head. I also happen to be a detective. I am a pretty damn good detective but because of my appearance it's hard to come by clients so I rely on those who know me to get my name out to potential new clients. 
                    Not saying I wish for people to end up in harm or missing so I can pay my bills but ducks have to eat. Plus I need to pay Dolores for her work too. She’s a good kid. Don’t need her regretting working for a duck.
